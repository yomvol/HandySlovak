# HandySlovak

This script is essentially sibling of [Handy Czech](https://github.com/yomvol/HandyCzech). It supplements English and Russian keyboard layouts to type unique to Slovak letters.
RightAlt+d = ď Shift+RightAlt+s = Š RightCtrl+a = ä and so on...
AutoHotkey supports Windows only. The script works on my machine :)
